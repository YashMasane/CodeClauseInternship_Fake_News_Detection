## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based fake news detection system. It leverages various classification models to analyze text data and make predictions about the authenticity of news articles.

## Datasets
The project utilizes two datasets: one containing fake news articles and another with true news articles. These datasets are preprocessed, checked for null values, and merged into a single dataset for analysis.

## Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing stage involves:
- Checking for null values and handling missing data.
- Removing unwanted columns or features.
- Creating a new column, 'class,' to label the news articles as fake or true.
- Merging the fake and true news datasets.
- Shuffling rows in dataset

## Feature Engineering
Feature engineering is crucial for converting text data into numerical features. This project uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to transform the text data into feature vectors that machine learning models can process.

## Model Selection
Various machine learning classification models are explored in this project, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

Each model is trained and evaluated to determine its effectiveness in fake news detection.

## Model Evaluation
Model performance is assessed using accuracy score. This allows for a comprehensive evaluation of each classification model's ability to distinguish between fake and genuine news.

## Manual Testing
A manual testing function is provided to test the trained models on new news articles. It demonstrates how to use the models for real-world fake news detection.

## Getting Started
